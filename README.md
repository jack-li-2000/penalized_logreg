 penalized_logistic_regression


This is a classification project used to identify handwritten numbers. 

This project is for the express purpose of demonstrating a mathematical understanding of the concept 
of gradient descent and logistic regression methods for classficiation. 

The model is a penalized logistic regression model created in R from scratch. 

The optimization algorithm used is gradient descent. 

Future iterations on this project can include using cross validation to pick hyperparameters.
